Goods are concrete things you can touch, see, consume, and will last a period of time to satisfy humans wants or needs.

In modern economies, goods are typically exchanged for currencies. The movement of the economies can thus be simplified for analysis by studying the general flow and cycle of goods and currencies.

However our incomes will often never outpace our goods, although capitalism as a system is doing its dardnest to make peeps work for it. Maybe we should value instead a society that's focused less on consumerism or even technological development for the pursuit of fufillment. but that's a whole nother thing...
