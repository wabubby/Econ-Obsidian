The simplification for [[Economic Model]] that variables other than ones our study focuses on do not change. This is very helpful for focusing and testing economic hypotheses.

In our orange case, price obviously isn't the only influencing variables to the number of purchases. Population and cultural stigma like health campaigns change the demand. But by enforcing the ceteris paribus, we can focus on the relationship between just these two variables.
