the spending of money for goods and services.

One will need to balance Wants and Needs, to fulfill a moderate portion of psychological needs and investing for the future.

There are two types of expenses:
- [[Fixed Expenses]]
- [[Variable Expenses]]


There's lots of different ways to spend:

|          |   Pros   |   Cons   |  
| -------- | -------- | -------- |  
| [[Cash]]     | Legal Tender,<br>Readily Available<br>Tangible      | Tangibility       |  
| [[Credit]]   | Virtually Tracked,<br>Portable, <br>Secure      | Interest     |  
| [[Loans]]    | negotiable interest, <br> negotiable amount      | loan debt traps       |  
| [[Leases]]   | negotiable, low prices <br> no burden of ownership (ie. maintenance)      | Rent       |  

Identifying the use cases of each and their downsides is crucial in your day-to-day economic goals.

Examples:
- You will likely use cash in day to day purchases because those purchases are small and cash is portable.
- you will likely use credit for large purchases, like washing machines, bills, cars, because those can be monitored for illegal action and budgeting. Cash would be unviable in these situations.
- you will likely take out loans for huge purchases (home mortgage, first car), due to high cost and expectation you will be using it for the duration of the loan.
- most uni/college students lease residents for its substantially lower cost and expectation of leaving in a few years or months
