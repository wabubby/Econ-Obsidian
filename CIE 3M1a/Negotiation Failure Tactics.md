When the [[Negotiation Process]] fails, the union and employers will throw hands until an agreement comes up. These lower income and revenue.

**Lock-out**: employer suspends employment
**Strike**: labor halts work
**Work-to-rule**: workers perform the bare minimum of their job description.
- teacher just gives textbooks and does nothing else.
- workers will do a shitty job on purpose lol
**Boycotts**: union encourages consumers to not buy employer products
**Back-to-work Legislation**: Government orders strikes and lockouts to end eventually and imposes a settlement themselves.

These tactics lower income and revenue directly. Related industries and consumers are also affected by production.
- fry industry will be severely hurt if the potato farmers' union go on strike.
