The assets put aside for future ventures with the intention of returns  or profit. 
- [[Savings]]
- [[Stocks]]
- [[Bonds]]
- [[Real Estate]]
- [[Mutual Funds]]
- [[GIC]]
- etc.

More risky than [[Savings]], but with the chance of scaling with inflation or exceeding it. Or your assets diminish in value lol.
