In the [[Labor]] market, the firms are the consumers and the supply is the workforce. Demand is derived determined by the productivity for workers.

Due to the ass backwardness, the labor curve is identical to typical market curves, with a few interesting caveats:
- **Price** would be the fixed cost of wages.
- All **Supply and Demand Determinants** remain more or less the same:
	- [[Labour Supply Determinants]]
	- [[Labour Demand Determinants]]
	- Supply determinants
		- Market Size - population
		- Price of Substitutes - other job markets
		- Price per Production/Wage - money
		- Producer Expectations - market predictions
		- Personal Tastes - worker interest
			- job interest, vacation times, conditions, scheduling, danger
	- Addition of Government Regulations (tax rates, regulations, etc.)

- Equilibrium point is the wage determination
	- otherwise cause labor surplus and shortage
