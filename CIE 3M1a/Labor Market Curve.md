In the [[Labor]] market, the firms are the consumers and the supply is the workforce. Demand is derived determined by the productivity for workers.

Due to the ass backwardness, the labor curve is identical to typical market curves, with a few interesting caveats.
- **Price** would be the fixed cost of wages.
- **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor** is the Marginal Revenue for each worker employed.
- All **Supply and Demand Determinants** remain the same:
	- Supply determinants
		- Market Size - population
		- Price of Substitutes - other job markets
		- Price per Production/Wage - money
		- Producer Expectations - market predictions
		- Personal Tastes - worker interest
			- job interest, vacation times, conditions, scheduling, danger
	- Demand Determinants
		- Market Size
		- Price of Substitutes
		- Income
		- Consumer Expectations
		- Personal Tastes
			- dominated by [[Worker Productivity]].
	- Addition of Government Regulations (tax rates, regulations, etc.)
- Equilibrium point is the wage determination
	- otherwise cause labor surplus and shortage
- Due to the taste differences of each individual "product", every worker has a different supply curve and thus different equilibrium wages.
	- **Wage Differential** is the difference in wages of two employees, affected by independent personal tastes changing the supply curve
