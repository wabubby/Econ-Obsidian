	- my robot assistant is building a massive cake (economic growth) with great speed (productivity and efficiency)
	- in the Minecraft basement, I can see my kids mining (full employment)
	- I go up to their identical bedrooms and put 10 dollars each(income equity) from my massive piggy bank (low public debt)
	- before I go to bed, I twirl my globe (viable balance of payments)

**Intro to Macroeconomics
- Consumer Price Index
	- role: measure price stability, adjust wages, fiscal policy
	- measurement: price of representative basket from current year compared to last
		- 2024 (base year): $234 - CPI 100
		- 2025: $249 - CPI 106.4
	- limitations:
		- weighted basket is subjective
		- not all families are families of four
		- spending proportions are variable
- Inflation Rate
	- Calculation: (CPI2 - CPI1) / CP1 x 100
- Gross Domestic Product
	- role: measure economic growth and productivity
	- Consumption + Government Expenditure + Investment + Net Exports
		- C: final goods (no intermediates)
		- I: infrastructure, capital goods, business inventories
	- limitations:
		- Population: Size is a huge factor
		- Inflation: Nominal GDP doesn't account for inflation
		- Non-Marketed Production: stay-at-home parents or charity no
		- Underground/Illegal economy not accounted for
		- Other Goals
			- environment, freedom, income equity, happiness, etc.
- Unemployment Rate
	- role: measure employment
	- measurement: unemployed / labor force x100%
	- limitations:
		- do not include retirees who would rather be working
		- make no distinction on type of work: doctor vs glue sniffer
		- hidden unemployment: workers who gave up or part-timers/gig
- Types of Unemployment
	- might not need to remember this lol....
	- Structural: workers' skills no longer needed
		- technology or moving industry to like another country
	- Geographical: unemployment in a specific place
	- Frictional: between jobs
	- Cyclical: economy cycles
	- Seasonal: fishing
	- Classical: wages are too high for companies to afford

**Business Cycle and Fiscal Policy**
- Aggregate Supply and Demand Features (2)
	- full employment equilibrium
	- capacity
		- changes with efficiency or numba of inputs
- Two Axes of fiscal Policy (4)

	- Time lags: recognition lag, decision lag, implementation lag, impact lag
	- Government budget: spending over taxes
		- deficit, balanced, surplus
