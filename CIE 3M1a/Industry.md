Industries are broad groups of [[Market]] producers.

- Good-producing
	- **Primary Industries** extract raw resources
		- eg. farming, fishing, mining, forestry
	- **Secondary Industries** manufacture from raw resources
		- eg. steel mill, automobile, pizza
- Service-producing
	- **Tertiary Industries** provide more general-audience services
		- wholesale, retail, hospitals, schools
	- **Quaternary Industries** provide highly specialized and expensive services
		- development labs, nuclear tech, information design, tech clinics

The order of these industries is not just organizational but chronological. Civilizations will almost always develop their industries in this order.
