Traditional [[Economic System]], as the name suggests:

- WHAT: produce same goods and quantities of the past.
- HOW: skills and natural resources opportunities are passed along family lines.
- WHOM: free market decides consumption (not super stable).

The traditional economy was dominant before the industrial revolution forced them to evolve, but you can still find these economies rurally isolated communities and countries (some Midwest communities, African tribes).
