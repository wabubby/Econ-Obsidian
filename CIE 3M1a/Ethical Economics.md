The stereotypical view of economics is a pure static study of maximizing profits and wants as efficiently as possible whilst not considering personal fufillment. this couldn't be further form the truth. Although it is true that the currency exhcange system in economies encourages material gain (and most who study economics do it for this purpose), it also enables people to improve the world and enforce and achive their personal worldviews.

This is where a distinction is made in the study of economics. Traditional economics, also known as [[Analytical(Positive) Economics]], studying the facts and values to typically maximize economical decision making. And [[Normative(Policy) Economics]], that concerns and express personal worldviews. In today's global economy, the consideration of both facts and values is crucial for a healthy future and wisse economic decisions.

Without positive economics, we are prone to making huge lapses in judgement or underselling consequences. policy economics are important in maintaing a worldview against billions of individual stakeholders.
