- Solow Model: sustanability requires a very high degree of substitution
- Nordhaus Model: sustainability needs a sufficiently large rate of technological progress, the presence of permanent backstop technlogy and some degree of possible
- Malthusian Model: Sustainability is incompatible with economic growth and we gonna die
