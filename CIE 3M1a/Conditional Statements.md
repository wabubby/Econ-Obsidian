Are forecasts based on careful analysis of economic behaviour. These often take the form:

	"if x occurs, y will follow."

For example, some economists predicted that

	"If the federal and provincial goverments lowers the tax of cigarettes to combat smuggling, purchases of canadian cigarettes will increase and people will buy more."

Through careful analysis of the economy, they forecasted the future. amaaaaazing. cool. wizards? As Economics is literally the multiplicative sum of billions of stakeholder choices, it is impossible to fully predict the economy. People are fickle and not logical, complex, succeptible, contextual varying.
- we can predict that people will stay outside on a hot day
- but there are always that ppl that have things to do on those days for a number of factors, or are just crazy enough to really like heat
