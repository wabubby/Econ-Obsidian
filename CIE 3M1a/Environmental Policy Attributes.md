Various attributes used to judge [[Environmental Policies]]:

- Cost-Effectiveness: Does the instrument attain the target at least cost?
	- In order to do this, it must satisfy the [[Least Cost Theorem]], where marginal cost of abatement is equal for all parties.
	- this ensures minimal total, societal cost
- Equity: What implications does the instrument have for distribution of wealth.
	- can the distribution be balanced? does money go to the people or to the firms? can property redistribution be corrupted by politics and vibes?
- Uncertainty: How large are the consequences when incorrect data is fed to the instrument?
	- how much does the device rely on unreliable data?
- Information: How much info is required, and what is the cost of acquiring it?
	- does the information constantly need to be re-fed, or will the device self-regulate? that would be nice fr.
- Long-run effects: How does the influence of the instrument change over time?
	- will the device stand the test of time of technology and innovation? how will the device change with the environment?
- Dynamic Efficiency: Does the instrument create continual incentives to improve products or production processes?
	- or does the device promote stagnation? abating **just** enough?
- Dependability: To what extent can the instrument be relied upon?
	- does it need to be aided with other policies? constantly upkept and examined by agencies?
- Flexibility: can the instrument be easily tweaked and adapted to new targets?
	- how easy is it to increase sustainability goals or respond to the quickly changing innovation and environmental landscape?
- Ancillary Benefits: Does the use of the instrument allow for a double dividend to be achieved? Both reducing pollution and reducing costs associated with tax system by making other taxes obsolete.
