1. Observation: select an economic question to be answered: 
	1. Observation: People buy oranges in different amounts throughout the year.
	2. Question: "Why do people buy oranges more some weeks than others?"
2. Idenfity Variables that answer the question
	1. quantity or quality variables
3. Hypothesize variable relationships
	1. if the prices increase, the quantity of oranges decrease
	2. if the orangse are imported, their prices increase
	3. data must uphod hypothesis
		1. lots of statistics in economics, tests
4. Make assumptions: it is impossible to conclude with simplifications
	1. ie. the price of oranges is the only variable that influences the quantity of oranges bought
	2. ie. people buy oranges to get the best satisfaction possible
5. test the hypothesis (not in this course)
6. compare the hypothesis to the real world outcome
	1. outcome: reject or agree with the hypothesis
		1. hypothesis would be rejected if price of oranges increase and the sales also increased
