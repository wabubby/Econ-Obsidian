Inflation is an inevitable rise of prices (reducing the value of money capital) due to a variety of factors, mainly demand and supply dynamics and the supply chain.

On one hand, those with static incomes will be able to afford less, degrading the quality of life. On the other hand, inflation is a health phenomenon that discourages hoarding, increasing circulation.

Inflation is typically recorded with the [[CPI]], or consumer price index.
