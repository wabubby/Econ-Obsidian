The Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) is a crown corporation that ensures people don't lose their money when the [[Bank]]s go bankrupt, which happened during the depression when they ran out of reserves and made it a whoooole lot worse.

The CDIC is funded by reserve ratios and public funds to operate. This of it as a double reserve.
