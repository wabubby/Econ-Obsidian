A form of [[Floor Prices]] concerning the labour market.

	Yeah, labour market is weird to think about. The producers are the consumers and the consumers are the product?

Anyways, long story short: minimum age creates a surplus cuz more people are willing to work while the producers are also more hesitant to recruit.
- some workers get a more livable wage
- less people able to find jobs.

As always with these interventions: worth? worth? in some situations, and at certain prices, yes. but who knows? The consequences of these things will ALWAYS be controversial.
