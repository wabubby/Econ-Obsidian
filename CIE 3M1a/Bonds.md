Government & Corporation issue bonds to raise money. 
- you loan money for the promise of later return with interest

Bonds are virtually risk-free. But the safer, the less interest.

- ie. the government issued war bonds during the world wars to fund the military. people were motivatred by interest, and their money wouldn't matter if they country collapsed anyways lol.
