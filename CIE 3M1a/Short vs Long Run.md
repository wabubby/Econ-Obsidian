In the long run, all [[Fixed vs Variable Expenditure]] are variable. In the grand scheme of things, any firm will be able to change it's rent, it's loans, and whatever! In the super short term, you can't cancel costs that would typically be considered variable!

To distinguish these time scales, Economists use the incredibly vague terms "in the Short Run" and "in the Long Run."

- **Short Run** refers to the period where all production is fixed because all costs are fixed.
	- that period where the company has ordered 80 papers that week, and they are limited to 80 prints per week. That is the SHORT RUN.
- **Long Run** refers to the period where all costs are variable.

Their vagueness is intended, as different firms would have very different periods, some would be days, some would be decades.
