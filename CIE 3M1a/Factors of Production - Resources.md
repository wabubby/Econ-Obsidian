So why can't we just create an infinite number of [[Goods]] and [[Services]] to satisfy our endless needs and wants? Well, their production requires a limited number rof resources.

This definition is so broad, it is helpful to divide Resources into a number of terms:
- [[Land-Natural Resources]] - stone, wheat - natural resources with value
- [[Labour - Human Resources]] - aka labour, both manual and not
- [[Capital]] - the resources whose values is derived in the production of other goods.
- [[Intermediate Goods]] - goods that physically make up other goods
	- these do not really fall under a major category of factor of production
