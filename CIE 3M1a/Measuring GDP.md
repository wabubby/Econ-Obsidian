[[GDP]] can be measured in two ways:

The **Income Approach** adds up all the incomes in an economy.
GDP = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profits

The **Expenditure Approach** adds up all spending in an economy.
GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditures + Net Exports

We know that these two approaches will result in equal values because of the basic principle that every dollar spent becomes someone's income. they should be exactly the same! Any statistical discrepancy is attributed to error in measuring and underground markets.
