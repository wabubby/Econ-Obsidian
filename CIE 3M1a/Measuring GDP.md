[[GDP]] can be measured in two ways:

The **Income Approach** adds up all the incomes in an economy.
GDP = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profits

The **Expenditure Approach** adds up all spending (towards final goods) in an economy.
GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditures + Net Exports (exports minus imports)
- Consumption is the purchase of final goods/services by households
- Government is the spending of Government
	- taxes are giving money to the government????
	- they are the additional spending that comes with rent, purchasing goods, whatever
	- i guess it makes sense to put them here
	- increase tax rates means increase spending to government
	- schools, highways, wages, office supplies. government firms.
- Investment is the purchase of capital goods
	- business inventories, buildings
- Net Exports refers to exports minus imports
- these explicit categories help prevent overlap and multi-counting


We know that these two approaches will result in equal values because of the basic principle that every dollar spent becomes someone's income. they should be exactly the same! Any statistical discrepancy is attributed to error in measuring and underground markets.
