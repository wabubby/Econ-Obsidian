different scale [[Industry]] businesses have different laws. this scale is enforced by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB)

- **Small** Businesses: x<=49 employees
	- maintain competitive in niche markets; sensitive

- **Medium** Businesses: 50<= x <= 499 employees

- **Big Businesses**: 500<= x employees
	- make up ~50% of jobs in Canada.
	- great political and economic influence.
	- competition legislations prevent market domination(which results in market manipulation)

- **MULTINATIONAL Corporations (MNC)** are those with international influence.
	- multiple headquarters, larger market audience, more resource markets, stability
	- potential for huge political and economic influence.
		- normative economics? bye bye!
	- very expensive to maintain.

So many American corporations have set up in Canada, we've called it a branch-plant economy.

**brain-drain** is phenomenon where the smart people are leaving to work in other economies, reducing economic growth and productivity. very sad.
