A property of the [[Coase Theorem]], when people have to pay.

- Strict Liability - injurer/polluter has to pay the full amount.
- Negligent Liabiltity - Injurer/polluter was doing the efficient pollution before hand, does not have to pay. They were maintaing a sufficient amount of caution.

downsides:
- However, it's not often profitable for small people to sue massive companies with like legal departments and shit. The EPA serves as a proxy for this suing, a public justice good.
- if the pollution has a timelag, it might be hard to make them pay, as when the damage is done, they might not even exist anymore.
