Cap and Trade, rather than try and fenagle with the marginal benefit and demand curves, or create artificial scarcity with an emission rate, just says FUCK IT and leaves everything to the market.

And of course, the market is a self-adjusting, optimizing system. We create artificial scarcity with permits that put a cap on pollution. Re-allocation of production to most efficient areas naturally happens.c

This policy only works, like all markets if:
- bargaining costs are negligible, aka there is no extra cost for a transfer other than the market cost.
- there is competition for these permits. they be cycling around.
- number of permits matches the emission limit.
initial allocation of permits does not effect efficiency, as they will cycle around. but there is a time lag. As long as the above thingies hold, which means no monopoly. Ain't nobody can enforce a subscription service for caps.

**PERMITS ARE ONE TIME USE**. Once you pollute they gone. it's not like a permit that grants you a rate of pollution, like I thought. Government reprints and redistributes once a year.
