System | Advantages | Disadvantages
------ |  --------- | -------------
Pure Traditional | stable, value on life | fragile system (poverty), lack of individual freedoms due to poverty
Pure Command | controlled/even distribution, eliminates buisiness fluctuations | lack of invdividual freedoms, authortiarian errors, no profit-motive efficiecny
Pure Market | individual freedoms, wealth, profit-motive encourage entrepeneurship | homogenous instability, profit-motive becomes dominant motive, income may not be enough to survive

Overall, each branch has a number of benefits and drawbacks. Central authorities can **efficiently motivate economies**, but can regularly become corrupt over time - benevolent dictatorships are ideal but **fleeting**. Free market gives more **power to the people**, but profit-incentive is **dangerous**. Pure traditional encourages those lacking **values**, but highly **limits change** and individual freedoms.
