Hey pigot, just cut out the middleman and tax them for emitting directly! Duh!

By imposing a tax for marginal damage, we force the marginal benefit of emission down. Since suppliers want their marginal benefit to be zero, we want to simply **set the tax rate to the intersection between environmental marginal damage and benefit**. This equilibrium will have our desired **socially optimal level of emission** and **shadow price**, which will be the tax rate. Like pigouvian subsidies, we just keep guessing the shadow price year by year, but that's shrimple.

Emissions abatement due a similar thing, reducing the marginal cost for abatement (equivalent to the marginal benefit of emission), moving quantity polluted to the efficient level.

Although a lot more technically complicated, for big brain nerds (it's really not that complicated), It fills in a lot of the properties, including low information, high effectiveness and generality. It earns A tier.

Since emissions abatement pays the polluters, C tier.
