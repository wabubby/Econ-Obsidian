Economics is defined as the science of [[Scarcity]] and "choice". For decades economists have studied thoroughly many details of economies to make the best choices.

Here are some **core** concepts in decision making:
- when decisions are made, one would want to [[Economize]] through [[Priority]].
- If the decisions reach the intended goal, they can be described as [[Effective]].
- However, if they also use a bare minimum of resources, they are also [[Efficient]].
- the cost paid of making one choice is called [[Opportunity Cost]]
- [[Ethical Economics]] is the discrete consideration of value judgement vs analysis.
- [[Economic Scale]] is the continuous consideration of economic scale.
- [[Economic Model]]s are simplifications used to aid in decision making.
