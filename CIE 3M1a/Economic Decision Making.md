Economics is defined as the science of [[Scarcity]] and "choice". For decades economists have studied thoroughly many details of economies to make the best choices.

Here are some core concepts in decision making:
- when decisions are made, one would want to [[Economize]] through [[Priority]].
- If the decisions reach the intended goal, they can be described as [[Effective]].
- However, if they also use a bare minimum of resources, they are also [[Efficient]].
- the cost paid of making one choice is called [[Opportunity Cost]]
