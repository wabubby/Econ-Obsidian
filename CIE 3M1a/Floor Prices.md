a form of [[Government Market Intervention]] of setting a minimum allowed price:

If set below the varying equilibrium point:
- demand outweighs supply, creating **surplus**
- **black markets** where people scalp unrestricted by the ceiling
- **disincentives entrepreneurship** of substitutes due to competitive prices
- suppliers willingly **degrade product** quality due to high demand
	- meeting demand is easy
