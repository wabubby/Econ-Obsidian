A political economy is a system categorization with integrated political and economical systems. Here are some we will be studying in this unit:

AUTHORITARIAN - more government influence (management-oriented)
LIBERTARIAN - less government influence (individual-oriented)

the horizontal axis of the political compass is concerned with how economical and social issues are dealt with:

**LEFT** (more socially centered values)
- acceptance of others, distribution of wealth
	- orthodox marxism
	- [[Communism]] - authoritarian gov for THE PEOPLE
	- [[Socialism]] - less intense communism
	- [[Capitalism]] - FREE MARKET
	- [[Facism]] - NAZIS
	- social darwinism
**RIGHT** (more individually centered values)
- individuality, maintenance of one's own wealth

As you can see, ideologies further from the center have more extreme values, and typically have a strong authoritarian government to uphold them.
