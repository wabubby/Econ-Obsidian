While pure private goods follow a healthy, MB = MC efficiency maximization, [[Public Goods]] are a VERY, VERY DIFFERENT STORY, as the marginal cost will match the aggregate of eveyrone's marginal benefits. 

Because the positive and negative effect of public goods are distributed, people should share the cost. However, in this situation it's very likely for the [[Freeriding Problem]]  and [[Tragedy of the Commons]] to occur.
