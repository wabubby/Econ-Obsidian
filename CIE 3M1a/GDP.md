Gross Domestic Product is a very commonly used macroeconomic benchmark for the [[Economic Goal]] of economic efficiency and productivity. 

Calculation: Consumption + Government Expenditure + Investment + Net Exports
- ONLY final goods sold are counted
	- intermediate goods
	- non-market transactions
	- illegal activity
- I: infrastructure, capital goods, business inventories

limitations:
- **Population** isn't accounted for
	- **GDP per capita** resolves this.
- **Inflation** isn't accounted for
	- [[Real vs Nominal GDP|Real GDP]] solves this
- Non-Marketed Production isn't accounted for
	- stay-at-home parents
	- charity
	- Underground economy
- Doesn't capture irregular market prices
- Double Counts [[Defensive Expenditures]]
	- expenditures used to combat costs from economic activity
	- water purification, doctor visits, medical masks
	- essentially the double counting of intermediate goods
- Other Economic Goals aren't accounted for
	- environment, freedom, income equity, happiness, etc.
	- GDP growth rate, HDI, and CPI, Unemployment rate are good for that
