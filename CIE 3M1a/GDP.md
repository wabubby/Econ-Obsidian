Gross Domestic Product is a very commonly used macroeconomic benchmark for economic success and productivity. As a purely statistical number, it does not accurately reflect normative values.

**Gross National Product (GNP)** was used to measure economic output of Canada prior to 1986.

**Real GDP** measures the net values of goods produced by a [[Market]]
- **final goods** and services are only considered.
	- intermediate goods are used to eventually make something else, not counted.
	- non-production resources such as bonds or stock do not contribute value to a market.
	- used goods are not counted.
	- non-market transactions such as unpaid labor do not count.
	- illegal activities are not counted.
- takes into account the values of different currencies.
- only cares about the timeframe of a **single year**.
- **exports** count only if the the goods were produced by the country
- only counts good sold in a **market** for money capital, not trading.

**Nominal GDP** is identical to GDP except it doesn't take into account currency value differences. eg. inflation or different currency types.

**Real GDP per Capita** is a common ballpark for economic health.
**Real GDP Growth Rate** is another great ballpark for changing economic health.
