The dictionary definition for economics is the science dealing with the production, distribution, and use fo goods, services, resources, and wealth. Its etymology dates tot he greek work "oikos", meaning to manage.

Today, we refer it as the **science of [[Scarcity]] and choice**. Every individual or group attempts to economize these choices. Each choice affects a numbers of Stakeholders. The Value of Economics comes from the fact there IS scarcity.

[[Transaction]] are the backbones of economies, driven by [[Scarcity]].

imagine an alternate reality where there was no sacrcity, and the people who studied economics were useless nerds, like hydrologists. hah! imagine if hydrologists were actually useful!
