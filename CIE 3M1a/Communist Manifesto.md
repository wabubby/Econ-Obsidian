A document written by [[Karl Marx]] and less popular Friedrich Engels advocating for the working class's revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system for you guessed it - communism.

It's structure was developed with four points:

- **Class Struggle**: History is shaped around conflicts between bourgeoise and proletariat classes.
- **Capitalism is Evil**: Capitalism promotes profit above all, leading to the exploitation of the working class, economic inequality, and alienation between classes.
- **Revolution**: The only way to address the revolution would be for the proletarians to revolt against bourgeoise.
- **Communism, the obvious answer**: Rather than doing the charade all over again, communism would be a classless society where wealth and resources are owned collectively, and no private property. Everyone would get what they need, hold hands and sing songs under the rainbow. And they all lived happily ever after.

In summary, the Communsit Manifesto called workers to action to overthrow their capitalist system in favour of communism. This document was a huge historical device.
