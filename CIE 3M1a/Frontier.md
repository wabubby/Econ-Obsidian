The max Production Possiblities curve achieved through the simplification of **full employment** and **productive efficiency**.

Because of... reality the frontier is basically impossible to achieve. The state of economies can be represented by points
- below the graph - unemployment of resources or productive inefficiency
- above the graph - unattainable

this is why this model is so useful because it can display a number of different economic attributes:
[[Economic Point]]
[[Economic Growth & Decline]]
