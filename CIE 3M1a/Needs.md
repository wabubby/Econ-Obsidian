Needs, aka Physical Wants, are the basic human physical requirements to sustain human life - food clothing, shelters. These physical needs are constant everywhere - although the goods needed to satisfy them vary on one's economical or environmental context. 

For example, coats would very much be considered in a need of clothing in the high arctic, but some african tribes use clothing purely for social status - clothing is not needed to satisfy their physical need of temperature.

Another, albeit less obvious environmental factor in needs are the cultural attitudes. After all, individual being able to integrate in society is crucial in most countries. For example, the consumption of dog or horse meat is generally not acceptable is many western countries.
