[[Firm]] owned by a group of people, imagine a much larger partnership.

All the pros of sole partnerships, but much more corporate leaning (less flexibility, more democracy means less aggressive management). Comes in both limited and unlimited liabilities..

Co-operatives have fairly unique principles:
1. Democracy: all members have a vote.
2. Fixed Rate of Return: not meant to increase investment.
3. Surpluses/Dividends paid in proportion to how much business each member brings.


Historically, fishermen and farmers made co-operatives to help each other and prepare for events a single proprietorship couldn't handle. However, their democratic nature highly hinders flexibility.
