An [[Economic Goal]].

Economically, unemployment is the state of not doing work. This is bad because:
- lowered production and spending (aka circulation)
- unemployed are government burdens
- social climate (no money is kinda bad)
	- crime
	- protests
	- poverty
	- wealth gaps
	- etc.

There are four major causes of unemployment, caused by change:
1. **Frictional**: Worker changes job; briefly looks for a new one.
2. **Seasonal**: Climatic changes cause market stress; typically periodic and expected durations.
	1. fishing becomes more saturated during certain seasons, farming, etc.
	2. tech has mitigated these effects somewhat today, like GMO crops
3. **Structural**: Socioeconomic changes change different skill needs.
	1. Automation (tech determinant) -> lower manual labor demand -> labor surplus
	2. **Replacement**: Employment outsourced foreignly (subset of structural)
		1. outsource agr to US -> lower farmer demand -> labor surplus
	3. **Technological**: tech advances cause structural change
4. **Cyclical**: Downturns in economic activity; natural capitalism.
	1. Positive feedback loops cause dips in circulation. This is a marxist crtique.
	2. Great Depression -> less purchase -> less production -> less employment -> ...
