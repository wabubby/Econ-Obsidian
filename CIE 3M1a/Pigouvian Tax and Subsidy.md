Pigouvian Taxes and Subsidies are a tax rate for production and subsidy rate for pulling back production. In the end, we try to set these rates to reduce quantity produced.

Our boy pigot says to set tax to marginal damage at the efficient allocation. This way, polluters will reduce their production to this point. For subsidies, do the same thing, but pay them for reducing. Either way, polluters will reduce production to match this subsidy rate.
You won't hit the tax rate correctly, but you can just keep guessing year by year with better data and measurements without complete law reforms.

Here are line graphs that illustrate the idea. Of course, the reality is there are many different firms with different productions who are competing and have nonlinear curves, but the idea remains the same:

Pigouvian taxes generate money, auto-correct, and can just be changed easily year-to-year with better data. No freaky laws here, just a simple tax rate on production. A tier.

Pigouvian subsidies reward polluters and take money from normies. Also, polluters can just say the equilibrium is further than it actually is. Worse than Pigouvian taxes in every way. D tier.
