A common form of [[Ceiling Price]] where rent prices are fixed.

However, due to the inelastic nature of Housing supply, shortages are exceptionally common.
- Long Lines
- Black Market - some renters pay extra under the table due to extremely high demand
- Quality - landlords find it extremely easy to skimp on quality without much consequence
	- there is too much demand - they're neva gonna run out!

Yes, like all ceiling prices, this intervention helps a substantial population meet living conditions. However, in the common case of shortages, a great number will never be able to access it at all. Those who do will typically circumvent laws and producers have a huge advantage in these shortages. 

The question with these interventions is: WORTH?
