Canada does not have a defined metric for [[Poverty]], but instead uses various boundaries to define "low income".

- **Low Income Cut-offs**: income thresholds where a family will devote more of it's income on necessities (food, shelter, clothing) than the "average" threshold.
- **Market Basket Measure**: defines low income based on a specific set of goods and services that represent the threshold of basic standard of living.
- **Low Income Measure:** defines low income as abeing a below a fixed percentage of income (below 50% of median household incomes.)

Using these three distinct low-income thresholds, there are anywhere from 3 to 4.5 millions with "low-income".
