[[Market]] Competition is one of the driving forces of Adam Smith's Laissez faire capitalism. 

Competition also allows consumers to keep corporations accountable:
- acceptable prices
- acceptable quality
- acceptable ethics (sourcing, practices, etc.)
Competition also incentivizes companies to stay away from oversaturated markets, promoting choice variety and innovation (firms just want that money money).

[[Competition Determinants]] are the factors affecting market structure.
[[Competition Structures]] describe market competition.
