Marginal Choices are choices of tiny differences. 

- Eating 12 chips instead of 10
- sleeping for 7 instead of 8 hours

The majority of choices people will make will be marginal choices. Change is hard, and most people change subtely from outside influences.
- eg. a student is not likely to completely change their studying outlook, but are more likely to make marginal choices altering their studying
	- likeee meeee! slowly adopting to these new softwares, not completely diversifying but trying Obsidian for a single unit.

Rational people will think at the margin to expeirment safely with change. Although not always the most efficient, it is human instinct.

Marginal choices are efficient because if someone is as efficient as possible, it should be impossible to alter their behaviour to be better off.
