"Each increase of a resource would be less and less productive"

Going from 100 to 150 is bad because now it's getting way too crowded and people are getting injured. This would increase production, but the output would increase by less than 50%. If the factory would to hire even more people beyond the point of maximum output, they would at some point get negative returns.
