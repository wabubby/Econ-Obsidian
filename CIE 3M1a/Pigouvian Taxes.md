Our boy pigot says to set tax to marginal damage at the efficient allocation. This artificially sets marginal cost with the added marginal damage, which will automatically give "efficient allocation."
- now, the only problem is deciding what is the efficient allocation amount, which science nerds!
- after pigourvian tax, the price rises while quantity falls. this is the natural outcome of moving the supply curve left, while keeping the demand, the marginal benefit lower.

Downsides:
- you need to know the exact marginal damage, likely through trial and error to keep quantity the correct length.
