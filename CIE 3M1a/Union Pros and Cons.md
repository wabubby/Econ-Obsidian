Are [[Labor Union]]s actually a good thing? As an intervention, they allow workers to improve their work conditions, leaning towards normative economics. Of course, this will hurt production in some ways. That's arguable. nah it's not. 

**Pros**
- incentive to work
- protection from dismissal
- accountability
- investment in education

**Cons**
- restrict labour mobility (security clauses, seniority, COLA, etc.)
- workers protected by seniority
- reduced efficient resource allocations (oh no the employers can't do whatever)
- contribute to unemployment due to increased wage demands
	- increased wage -> less demand
