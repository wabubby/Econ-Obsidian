Values judgement statements are based on the values of indivudals or groups, and thus cannot be verified and efficient or the most effective.  They typically take the form:

> `"x is what is ought to be"

For example:

	"Municipal governments should provide shelter for the homeless."

This statements is based on value judgements, but even something as morally righteous as this can be disastrous. Shelter for the homeless may have people economize less, or make a country prone to attacks due to lack of funding.
