A [[Weak Sustainability]] "rule" to have **sustainable usage** of a **non-renewable resource**:

Simply **invest** all your excess rent from this resource into **other forms of capital**.


# Vital Assumptions that totally don't make the rule basically useless
- you can actually substitute the non-renewable for these new forms of capital
	- replacing gasoline with electric
- the value of the good is dervied from its manufacturing, not consumption of the raw resource itself.
	- you can't exactly replace pistachios with crackers without erasing the existing market
