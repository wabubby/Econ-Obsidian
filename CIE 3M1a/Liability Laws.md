The simplest form of sustainable policy, just MAKE EM PAY, duh.

- **Strict Liability** - injurer/polluter has to pay the full amount.
- **Negligent Liability** - Avoiding payment requires proof that polluter were maintaining a sufficient amount of caution. There's always a risk to these things, as long as the polluter was up to code, we don't want to make them liable for rolling the dice like everyone else.

Since liability laws must be made precautionary, often become obsolete and overbearing, have massive time lags(the company may not even exist after the inhabitant's children have cancer) and flimsiness, I give Liability Laws a **D tier**. They feel like a static, band-aid solution that don't serve as a good dynamic solution.
