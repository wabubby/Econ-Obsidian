Written by the father of economics, [[Adam Smith]], this book is viewed like a Bible of economics. It seeks to explain and explore the behavior of economies:

- differences of wealth
- economic progress
- [[Division of Labour]]
- [[The Invisible Hand]]
- [[Laissez-Faire]]
- [[Extravagance]]
- No economy is good if most people are suffering.
- etc.

We're not going to be graded on the entire fucking book obivously, but those are some good principles to learn.
