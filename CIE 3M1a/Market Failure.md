At the end of the day, markets are distribution systems.

When markets fail to distribute efficiently, it is called a market failure. On their own, markets tend to do pretty well, up until:
- you deal with a non-private good -> unpaid social costs
- monopolies, collusion, corruption come in and fuck up market control
- overtuned government interventions
