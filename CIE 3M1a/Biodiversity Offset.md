"*Biodiversity offsets are measurable **conservation outcomes** resulting from actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising from **project development** **after appropriate** prevention and mitigation measures have been taking.*"

-the BBOP (Business and Biodiversity Offset)

The goal of biodiversity offsets is to achieve no **net loss** of biodiversity:
- species composition
- habitat structure
- ecosystem functions
- cultural values
- people's use associated with biodiversity

This idea is controversial because as a big company, do whatever the hell you want as long as you "offset it with some more biodiversity," which is a vague, warpable term. To fix this, introducing the biodiversity hierarchy. The concept of biodiversity impact only works if the injurer properly avoids, mitigates, and restores. The **offset is for residual impact** that cannot be eliminated.
