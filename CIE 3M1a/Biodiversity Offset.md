Ensure a net positive **biodiversity offset** on residual impacts (that cannot be elimiated) after every project where avoidance, mitigation, and restoration has already been taken.

Well, what is **biodiversity**?
- species composition
- habitat structure
- ecosystem functions
- cultural values
- people's use associated with biodiversity

This idea is controversial because as a big company, do whatever the hell you want as long as you "offset it with some more biodiversity," which is a vague, warpable term. To fix this, introducing the biodiversity hierarchy. The concept of biodiversity impact only works if the injurer properly avoids, mitigates, and restores. The **offset is for residual impact** that cannot be eliminated.

Although the mitigation hierarchy does help, this seems very difficult to actually enforce in practice. It is definitely not self-governing and can be done sloppily and lazily, which it will do. The incentives are not there, this is just a liability law with more flavour. **C tier**.
