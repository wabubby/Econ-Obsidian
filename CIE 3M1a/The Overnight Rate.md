The [[Bank of Canada]]'s main method of controlling inflation indirectly through the dollar value and interest rates..

The Overnight Rate is set to the center of the **bank rate** and **deposit interest**, which are always 0.5 apart.
- If the bank rate is 4.0, and the deposit interest rate is 3.5, the overnight rate is 3.75.
- This range is called the [[Operating Band]].


How it works: Of course there are some time lags lmao.
