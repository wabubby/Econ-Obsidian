The Production Possibilities Curve is an [[Economic Model]] that very simply shows the relationship between the production of two goods, with each being displayed per axis.

The Curve, or [[Frontier]], is the most efficient and effective use or resources - 
productive efficiency. The curve measures each product's [[Relative Cost]] against one another.

Its incredible simplicity and readability is not without intense simplification:
- Two Products
	- the PPF only measures two products against each other.
- Fixed Production
	- does not take into sunk cost development. eg. technological improvement as production continue, not temporally concerned
- Full Employment
	- all productions are fully manned to full efficiency - human resources, natural resources, you name it.

**Productive Efficiency** means output is being produced at the fewest reources
