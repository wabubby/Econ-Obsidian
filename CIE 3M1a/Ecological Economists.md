A branch of pessimistic [[Sustainability Economists]] that believe we gotta put down full stops before shits gets to zero.

Aka the Modern Malthusists

- blame early neoclassical economists for assuming earth ecosystems were merely a source and sink for waste and resources. as they say "free gifts of nature." oh nah bruh
	- funnily enough malthusians often become overly pessimistic
		- malthus - equilibrium of misery
		- paul ehrlich - population bomb
	- they right, but they don't accept sustainability of economies of neoclassical sustainability economics
		- they argue that non-renewable natural capital CANNOT BE SUBSITUTED
		- argue that TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IS STAGNANT AND SUCKS
		- believe that only option is for government to **put down full stops**

- Ecological Economists instead believe economy is merely a subsystem of the greater economy
	- we have to consider our use and disposal of our natural resoruces
	- it's called "ecological" because the economy is merely a part of the great ecosystem

**Nowadays, the industry has shifted the demand curve left and even water and air are scare resources.**

ie. Paul Erlich
