[[Labor Union]]s sometimes do more than just grant negotiation power. They:
- generate demand for employer services
- increase productivity to increase labor demand
- restrict entry to reduce supply
	- apprenticeship
	- lobby for higher labour standards
- improve health and safety standards for portection
- injury and illness compensation

Groups of workers can do a lot together to improve their wages and secure their future.
