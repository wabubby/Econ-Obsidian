Theorize the structure of greater scope of [[Economic System]]s.

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Adam Smith]] are two of the most influential eocnomics theorist to have ever lived. The difference in their arguments highlights the normative, ever-shifting nature of economies as a social science.

- Smith promotes the development of classical economies through the relationship of self-interest and free markets.
- Marx completely critiques this idea, citing markets as the cause for inevitable class struggle and suffering. He advocates for shared wealth and social-interest.

We can cite the current suffering of today's economies as a result of not adopting to either extreme.
