general categories that illustrate how economies distribute and prioritise resources.

Due to their intrinsically complex nature, economic systems are hard to describe. By boiling it down, we can determine economic systems as a guideline for production:

- **What** to produce?
	- what goods/services to produce and in what quantities?
	- how should the choice be split among consumers, producers, and authorities?
	- there is no "right" answer and must be guided by some principles.
- **How** to produce?
	- what capital and resources should be consumed to produce?
	- what line is drawn for opportunity costs?
	- again, there is no "right" answer.
- **Why/For Whom** to produce?
	- who should the output of goods be distributed (and by extension, by what system are they distributed)?
	- no economy is able to produce for everyone - there is no "right" answer.

How economic system's answer these questions is a study of Normative Economics and is typically completely subjective - there are so many [[Economic Goal]] a nation could desire.

It is sisyphean to define an economy's answers to such questions, so it's easier to use predefined terms to describe how economies answer these questions.
Economic systems today can be typically represented as a [[Mixed Economy]] consisting of elements from these three:

- [[Pure Traditional Economy]] - not focused on improving technology
	- careers typically passed down thru heritage, as well as land
- [[Pure Command Economy]] - aka a planned economy with a planned system.
	- socialism, communism, etc.
- [[Pure Market Economy]] - aka capitalism lmao

But how do economies come to settle on these arbitrary answers? There are hundreds of factors:
- culture, climate, available resources, competition, history, etc. 
these factors tend to centrally funnel into a Political System that generally decides the answers to these questions. The study of the relationships between political systems and economies is [[Political Economics]].
