1. Observation
	1. select an **economic question** to be answered:
	2. we want to know why ppl buy diff amoutn of oranges at different weeks in the year:
	3. "Why do people buy more oranges in some weeks than others"?
2. Data Collection
	1. **identify the variables** - sometimes needs research
	2. temperature, weight, distance
	3. in our case, orange quality, quantity, and price
	   
	4. Make and Test Hypothesis
		1. simplify thru assumptions
		2. make and test hypothesis against real world
			1. collect and typically display data
3. Explanation
	1. Create a hypothesis
		1. **Model Building**: [[Economic Model]] simplify the problem thru assumptions - impossible to model the real world
		2. display these assumptions
			1. the price of the oranges is the only influence of buying
			2. ppl buy oranges to get best possible purchase satisfaction and no other reason
4. Verification
	1. test the hypothesis against the real world
		1. **econometrics** is a branch of statistics focusing on... make a guess...
		2. collect and typically display data
	3. typically also create a conclustion
