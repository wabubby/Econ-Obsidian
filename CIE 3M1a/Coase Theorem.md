**Externalities** arise because the **property rights** of some resources are not well defined, so their costs are ignored in the market place.

- For example, since the environmental cost of killing oxen has no place in the marketplace, people will do it because someone's going to do it anyways. In terms of private cost, it is free resources that someone will exploit eventually due to scale.
- If you sell the property rights of animals or natural wells to native people, it means firms will now have to pay a cost. Sure, the owners could just do whatever they want, but it's not economical anymore as owning limited non-renewables is obviously a massive investment.

For it's cost-effectiveness, favorable equity, dynamic efficiency with the market, and flexibility, I rate Coase Theorem in **S Tier**. I do like this one, a lot, although it doesn't work with larger scales.
