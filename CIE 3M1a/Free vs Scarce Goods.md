Free goods are [[Goods]] without opportunity cost. Although generally consistent thoughout most economies, some economies may fine certain resources considered free. One example would be fresh water in Canada, which overly abundant, compared to a place such as South Africa where it is very much not.
eg. Fresh Air, wood

Scarce goods, otherwise known as economic goods are the exact opposite - there are not enough of them to supply endless needs and wants. Whilst drinking water is a free good in Canada - bottled water is not due to the opportunity cost of piping, piping, purifying, and the manufacture of bottles.
