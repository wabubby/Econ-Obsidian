Human resources are value derived from human labour. This can be both manual or not. For example:
- Physical labour of farm or factory workers (not to say there isn't skill involved, but the majority of value is derived from manual labour)
- Intangible value of knowledgeable expertise from those such as advisory secretaries or research scientists

For economists, both farmers and musicians alike are contributing value to the greater society - both are resources.

Human resources can be extrapolated into a much more complicated topic. It is a driving force of capitalism as the system exploits everyone's natural physical skill or intangible potential to create value. If you think about it, all other forms of value, such as natural or capital goods are dervied from human resources.
