Due to their intrinsically complex nature, economic systems are hard to describe. But they can generally be represented as a [[Mixed Economy]] consisting of elements from these three:

- [[Pure Traditional Economy]] - not focused on improving technology
	- careers typically passed down thru heritage, as well as land
- [[Pure Command Economy]] - aka a planned economy with a planned system.
	- socialism, communism, etc.
- [[Pure Market Economy]] - aka capitalism lmao

The decision on what tendencies an economy takes are dependent on many factors: culture, climate, available resources, competition, history, etc. But these factors are always funneled  into the greater [[Political Systems]] to decide the overall structure. Knowing the political system of an economy can help one greatly infer many attributes of not just the economic system, but the general attributes of the country.
