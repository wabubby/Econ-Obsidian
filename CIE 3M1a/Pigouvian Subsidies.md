Pigouvian subsidies is the same idea of pigouvian taxes, except you pay people for reducing instead of taxing people for producing more.

But in the end, it has the effect of moving the marginal benefit left. N0T

Problems with pigouvian subsidies:
- you are actually rewarding polluters, so more will probably enter the market
- it's tougth to find the actual equilibrium, and polluters can say that the equilibrium is higher than it is
- the subsidies have to come from SOMEWHERE. creating more wealth inequality.
