the law of increasing returns to scale states that when inputs increase by let's say 100%, the output will increase non-proportionally, by more than 100%.

This is most evident in factories. When large companies invest in grander operations, the production price per product goes down and their returns increase to scale. McDonalds can sell way more burgers but use less resources per restaurant than South Street Burger, which is a compartively small chain.
