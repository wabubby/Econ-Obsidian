**Privately-Owned Business Organizations** engaged in both [[Cost]]s and [[Production]] in the [[Market]] to maximize **profits** (which as you can guess, only has good, normative outcomes). 

Come in five flavors of legal ownership status:
1. [[Sole Proprietorship]] - owned by a single
2. [[Partnership]] - owned by a few
3. [[Co-operative]] - owned by a lot
4. [[Corporation]] - owned by the firm itself
5. [[Government Enterprise]] - owned by the government

Firms are the driving force for Adam's Smith's Laissez faire capitalism. Distribution of Labour, Self-interest, free markets, and the invisible hand. Firms are the actual element that drive all of that in their market participation.
