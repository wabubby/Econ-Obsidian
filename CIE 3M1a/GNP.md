**The Market value of all final goods and services produced by nationals of a country in a given period of time**

Gross National Product, Similar to [[GDP]], was used to measure economic productivity prior to 1986. 
- It took into account the production of citizens across the globe rather than in the borders.
- GDP does a better job for the canadian market tho.

Limitations (Basically Equiavelent to GDP + Innacuracies):
- **Population** isn't accounted for
	- **GDP per capita** resolves this.
- **Inflation** isn't accounted for
	- [[Real vs Nominal GDP|Real GDP]] solves this
- Non-Marketed Production isn't accounted for
	- stay-at-home parents
	- charity
	- Underground economy
- Market Prices May be "Unfair" and/or subsidized
- Other Economic Goals aren't accounted for
	- environment, sustainability, freedom, income equity, happiness, etc.
	- GDP growth rate, HDI, and CPI, Unemployment rate are good for that
