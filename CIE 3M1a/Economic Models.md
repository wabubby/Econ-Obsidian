Economic models generally consist of a set of mathematical equations that describe a theory of economic behavior, although they can be depicted verbally. They seek to educate by:
- show relationship between dependent and independent variables
- simplifying economic reality through assumptions
- typically appeal to either analytical or normative economics

this simplification allows economists to assume, select variables, and make theories. Models are not always realistic representations - they show connections but not why they're connected.

There are two simplifications in Economic Model building:
- [[Ceteris Paribus Assumption]]
- [[Rational Self-Interest]]
- [[Rational Economic Decision-Making]]
