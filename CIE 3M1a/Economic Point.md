The movement of certain points can imply certain economic behaviours and events, and those events can be defined relative to the frontier. this is why this model is so useful.
- a point that exchanges one good for another implies a shift in focus
- a point with both increased resources implies improved full employment or productive efficiency
	- this choice has no opportunity cost by making better use of both resources
		- of course, within the ceteris paribus of this model
