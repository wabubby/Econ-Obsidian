Pure Command [[Economic System]]s as the name suggests:

- WHAT: the authority decides - authority owns resources and decides their use.
- HOW: the authority decides - authority owns resources and decides their distribution.
- WHOM: the authority decides - typically given depending on needs and skills.

These structure of these systems were always planned out before hand, and typically need a central authority to enforce. Many ideas from pure command economies arise out a desire to break free from the flaws of economic system tendencies.
