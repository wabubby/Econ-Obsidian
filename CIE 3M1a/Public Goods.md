All goods fall on a range from pure [[Private Goods]] to pure public goods.

**Pure Public** [Goods] are
- non-rival: they can't be competed for
- non-excludable: their consumption cannot be prevented without great difficulty
- ie. national defense, research, welfare programs, weather forecasts, parks
- ie. pure public bads: pollution, twilight series
