An [[Inflation]] metric that simply calculates the percent increase of good/service's cost at one time to another. But without the percent symbol cuz whatever.

Price Index  = Current Price / Base Price x 100

You can use this metric to account for inflation by dividing by the current price index and multiplying by 100. If they didn't remove the percentage symbol literally NONE of this would be a problem. sheeesh
