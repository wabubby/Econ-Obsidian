The resting **point** of the market as the intersection between the [[Supply and Demand Curve]].

The Equilibrium displays 
- equilibrium price aka market clearing price, P<sub>E</sub>
	- buyers and producers are satisfied - both sell what they want
- equilibrium quantity, Q<sub>E</sub>

- [[Surplus]] and [[Shortage]] pressure wobbling to this equilibrium.
	- Lower [[Surplus]] prices where quantity supplied > quantity demanded.
	- Higher [[Shortage]] prices where quantity demanded > quantity supplied.
	- Constant determinant shifts cause these brief imbalances before return to equilibrium

- **determinants** shift the equilibrium point
	- when supply and demand move in the same direction, Q<sub>E</sub> will also move in the same direction. price will vary.
	- when supply and demand move in opposite directions, P<sub>E</sub> will move in the direction of demand and opposite to supply.
	- for the sake of simplicity, the models we will be given will only have demand and supply move in equal increments to not worry about exact differences, just the typical flow of the market.
		- knowing all that information lets us calculate the exact Q<sub>E</sub> and P<sub>E</sub>, which we don't do because easy.
