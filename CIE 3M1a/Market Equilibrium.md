The resting **point** of the market as the intersection between the [[Supply and Demand Curve]].
- surpluses and shortages pressure wobbling to this equilibrium.
- determinants shift the point along both axes
	- increase in demand (demand shift), increases both the price and quantity of demand
	- increase in supply (demand shift), decreases in the price and increase in quantity of supply
